Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures changes over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption. They were originally introduced in some countries to increase wages for workers in order to balance the increase of the living costs (given by the CPI). Currently is used widely by governments and central banks as a macroeconomic indicator of inflation.

In this Tableau Visualization, we take a look on how much the inflation really affects european citizens and how much is lost to it. There is a deep dive to understand which categories affect the most and whether or not the minimum wage increases in order to attenuate the efects of inflation.
